<h1>Laptops Shop Calculator</h1>

<p>This repository contains a Python & C Language project for a simple Laptops Shop Calculator. The calculator is developed as a part of my first-semester project and aims to calculate the price of a laptop based on user-selected specifications. It prompts the user to provide details such as laptop generation, RAM size, ROM size, graphics type, and offers the option to include additional items like a mouse and keyboard, which are then factored into the total price calculation.</p> <br>
In 2nd semester, I further developed it in C Language.

<h2>Features</h2>

<ul>
  <li>Calculate the price of a laptop based on user-selected specifications.</li>
  <li>Prompt the user to provide details such as laptop generation, RAM size, ROM size, and graphics type.</li>
  <li>Allow the user to add extra items like a mouse and keyboard to the total price calculation.</li>
  <li>Generate a simple receipt that includes a reference ID, customer name, address, and payment method.</li>
</ul>

<h2>Installation</h2>

<ol>
  <li>Ensure that you have Python 3 installed on your system.</li>
  <li>Clone this repository to your local machine using the following command:<br>
      <code>git clone https://github.com/your-username/laptops-shop-calculator.git</code></li>
  <li>Navigate to the project directory:<br>
      <code>cd laptops-shop-calculator</code></li>
  <li>Run the main script:<br>
      <code>python main.py</code></li>
  <li>Follow the on-screen instructions to use the calculator and generate a receipt.</li>
</ol>

<h2>Usage</h2>

<p>Upon running the main script, the calculator will prompt you to provide the specifications of the laptop, such as generation, RAM size, ROM size, and graphics type. After that, it will offer the option to add extra items like a mouse and keyboard to the total price calculation. Once all the necessary information is collected, the calculator will generate a simple receipt that includes a reference ID (generated using the random function), the customer's name, address, and selected payment method.</p>
